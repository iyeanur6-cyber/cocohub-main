## The problem

Every time you switch vets, move cities, or face a pet emergency — your animal's medical history is either lost, on paper in a drawer, or locked inside another clinic's software. There is no portable, owner-controlled pet health record. **Until now.**

---

## What Cocohub does

Cocohub gives every pet a **tamper-proof digital health passport** — medication schedules, vaccination history, vet records, and emergency contacts — that lives on your phone, works offline, and can be shared with any vet via a QR code in seconds.

Records are verified on the **Stellar blockchain** (hashes only — no personal data ever on-chain), so any vet anywhere can independently confirm a record hasn't been altered.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥ 18, Docker Desktop

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/cocohub-mobileapp/cocohub-main.git
cd cocohub-main

# 2. Install
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 3. Run web app instantly (no backend needed)

## ⛓️ Blockchain Architecture

Cocohub uses a **dual-layer** approach — your data stays private:

1. **Storage** — Records stored encrypted on the Cocohub backend (AES-256)
2. **Verification** — A SHA-256 hash of each record is anchored on Stellar via `manageData`

**No personal data is ever written to the blockchain.** Only hashes. Any vet can verify a record independently by recomputing the hash and checking it against the on-chain value.

```
Record → SHA-256 hash → Stellar manageData tx → tamper-evident audit trail
```

**Stellar assets:**
- `PETC` — Cocohub utility token
- `VETH` — Vet Health Credits
- `PAWP` — PawPoints loyalty rewards
