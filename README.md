## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18
- Docker Desktop (for backend)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on your phone (for mobile testing)

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DogStark/Cocohub-MobileApp.git
cd Cocohub-MobileApp
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 2. Run the web app

```bash
npx expo start --web
```

Open **http://localhost:8081** in your browser.

### 3. Run on your phone (Expo Go)

```bash
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with **Expo Go** on iOS or Android. Phone and PC must be on the same Wi-Fi.

### 4. Run the full stack (backend + database)

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL + Redis + API
docker-compose up

# In a new terminal — run migrations and seed test data
npm run migrate
npm run seed:dev
```

**Test credentials after seeding:**
```
Email:    owner1@example.com
Password: Password123!
```

## � Marketing Website

The `website/` folder contains the Next.js marketing site.

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3001
```

**Pages:**
- `/` — Landing page (hero, features, download CTAs)
- `/privacy` — Privacy Policy
- `/terms` — Terms of Service

**Environment:**
```bash
# website/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:8081   # local
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://app.cocohub.app  # production
```

**Deploy to Vercel:**
```bash
cd website
npx vercel --prod
```

---

## 📱 Testing on Device

### Expo Go (fastest — no build needed)
1. Install Expo Go from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
2. Run `npx expo start`
3. Scan the QR code

### Build a preview APK (Android)
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```
EAS builds it in the cloud and gives you a direct APK download link — no Play Store needed.

### Build for iOS
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```
Requires an Apple Developer account.

## 🌱 Database Seeding

```bash
npm run seed:dev     # 5 owners, 10 pets, records, appointments, medications
npm run seed:test    # Minimal — 2 owners, 1 vet, 1 pet
npm run seed:large   # 20 owners, 30 pets, large dataset
```

Seed data flags:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--owners` | 5 | Number of pet owner accounts |
| `--vets` | 3 | Number of vet accounts |
| `--pets` | 2 | Pets per owner |
| `--records` | 3 | Medical records per pet |
| `--appointments` | 2 | Appointments per pet |
| `--medications` | 1 | Medications per pet |

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
npm test                    # Unit tests (Jest)
npm run test:ci             # CI mode with coverage
npm run typecheck           # TypeScript check
npm run lint                # ESLint
npm run e2e:test            # Maestro E2E smoke test (requires device)
```

## ⛓️ Blockchain Architecture

Cocohub uses a **dual-layer verification** approach:

1. **Storage layer** — Medical records are stored encrypted on the Cocohub backend
2. **Verification layer** — A SHA-256 hash of each record is anchored on the Stellar blockchain via `manageData` operations

**No personal data is ever written to the blockchain** — only hashes.

**Stellar assets:**
| Asset | Description |
|---|---|
| `PETC` | Cocohub utility token |
| `VETH` | Vet Health Credits (redeemable for services) |
| `PAWP` | PawPoints loyalty rewards |

Future: Soroban smart contract for on-chain pet record registry with vet access control.

## 📦 App Store Submission

Assets and metadata are ready in:
- `storelisting/` — App Store + Google Play descriptions, keywords, release notes
- `legal/` — Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
- `assets/` — Icons and splash screen

See [storelisting/README.md](storelisting/README.md) for the submission checklist.

---

## 🔒 Security

- All local data encrypted with AES-256-GCM via `expo-sqlite`
- Auth tokens stored in device Keychain (iOS) / SecureStore (Android)
- HMAC-SHA256 request signing on all API calls
- SSL pinning for production API endpoints
- Biometric re-authentication on foreground
- Screen capture prevention on sensitive screens
- Circuit breaker + exponential backoff on all network calls
- Rate limiting and Helmet security headers on the backend
