```

### 4. Start the backend

```bash
docker-compose up
npm run migrate
npm run seed:dev
```

### 5. Run the app

```bash
# Web (fastest for development)
npx expo start --web

# Mobile (requires Expo Go on your phone)
npx expo start

## Development Workflow

```
main          ← stable, protected
  └── dev     ← integration branch, PRs target here
        └── feat/your-feature-name
        └── fix/issue-description
        └── test/what-youre-testing
        └── docs/what-youre-documenting
```

### Branch naming

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/short-description` | `feat/dark-mode-toggle` |
| Bug fix | `fix/short-description` | `fix/sos-button-crash` |
| Test | `test/short-description` | `test/medication-service` |
| Docs | `docs/short-description` | `docs/api-setup-guide` |

---

## Code Standards

We use ESLint + Prettier. Before every commit, run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Or let the pre-commit hook handle it automatically (via Husky).

### Key rules
- **TypeScript strict** — no `any`, proper return types
- **No console.log** in production code — use `loggerService`
- **Encryption** — never store sensitive data in plain AsyncStorage; use `encryptedAsyncStorage` or SecureStore
- **Stellar** — all blockchain operations go through `src/services/blockchainService.ts`
- **Tests** — new features must include at least one unit test

---

## Submitting a PR

1. Make sure your branch is up to date with `dev`
2. Run `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test`
3. Open a PR against the `dev` branch
4. Fill in the PR template (description, screenshots for UI changes, test steps)
5. Reference the issue: `Closes #123`
6. A maintainer will review within **3 business days**

### PR checklist

- [ ] Lint and type checks pass
- [ ] Tests pass (or new tests added)
- [ ] No `.env` secrets committed
- [ ] UI changes include a screenshot or screen recording
- [ ] Stellar-related changes tested on testnet first

---
