### ✅ Block PRs with critical or high severity vulnerabilities

**Implementation:**
- `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml` — npm-audit job blocking logic
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — security job in main CI pipeline
- Exit code 1 if critical/high vulnerabilities found
- Branch protection rules enforce blocking

**Verification:**
- PR blocking logic: `if [ "$CRITICAL" -gt 0 ] || [ "$HIGH" -gt 0 ]; then exit 1; fi`
- Status check name: `npm audit — Dependency Vulnerabilities`
- Branch protection configured to require passing checks

### ✅ Auto-create PRs for available security patches

- Includes detailed commit message
- References issue #59

**Verification:**
- Branch creation: `chore/security-patches-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- Commit message includes: "Closes #59"
- PR labels: `security`, `dependencies`, `automated`
- PR description includes reviewer checklist

### ✅ Generate weekly security reports for the team

**Implementation:**
- `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml` — security-report job
- Generates markdown report with recommendations
- Uploads as artifact (90-day retention)
- Comments on PRs with full report
- Includes vulnerability counts and next steps

**Verification:**
- Report file: `security-report.md`
- Artifact retention: 90 days
- PR comment includes recommendations
- GitHub Step Summary populated

### ✅ Configure Dependabot for automated dependency updates

**Implementation:**
- `.github/dependabot.yml` — complete configuration
- npm package updates: Weekly Mondays at 3 AM UTC
- GitHub Actions updates: Weekly Mondays at 4 AM UTC
- Auto PR creation with changelog
- Proper labeling and assignment
- Ignores major versions for critical packages

**Verification:**
- Version: 2
- Two update configurations (npm + github-actions)
- Schedules configured correctly
- Reviewers and assignees set
- Labels: `dependencies`, `security`, `ci-cd`, `github-actions`
