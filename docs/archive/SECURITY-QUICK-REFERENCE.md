# 🔒 Security Scanning — Quick Reference

Fast lookup guide for common security tasks.

## Commands

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm run audit

# Check for high severity only
npm run audit:high

# Fix vulnerabilities automatically
npm run audit:fix

# Force major version updates (use with caution)
npm run audit:fix:force

# Run full security check
npm run security:check
```

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| security-audit.yml | Every PR, daily on main | npm audit + Snyk scanning |
| security-patches.yml | Daily at 3 AM UTC | Auto-create PRs for patches |
| dependabot.yml | Mondays at 3 AM UTC | Weekly dependency updates |
| ci.yml | Every PR and push | Lint, tests, security check |

## PR Blocking

PRs are blocked if:
- ❌ Critical severity vulnerabilities found
- ❌ High severity vulnerabilities found

**Fix:** Run `npm audit fix` and commit changes

## Severity Levels

| Level | CVSS | Action | Timeline |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 | ❌ Block PR | Immediate |
| High | 7.0-8.9 | ❌ Block PR | 24 hours |
| Moderate | 4.0-6.9 | ✅ Allow | 2 weeks |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 | ✅ Allow | Regular updates |

## Common Issues

### PR Blocked by Security Check

```bash
# 1. Check what's wrong
npm run audit:high

# 2. Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# 3. Commit and push
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: fix security vulnerabilities"
git push
```

### Snyk Scan Fails

1. Check `SNYK_TOKEN` is set in GitHub Secrets
2. Verify token is valid at snyk.io
3. Check token has correct permissions

### Dependabot PR Not Creating

1. Wait for next scheduled run (Mondays 3 AM UTC)
2. Check `.github/dependabot.yml` syntax
3. Verify Dependabot is enabled in repository

### False Positive Vulnerability

1. Review vulnerability details
2. Verify it doesn't affect your code
3. Document in `docs/SECURITY.md` as accepted risk
