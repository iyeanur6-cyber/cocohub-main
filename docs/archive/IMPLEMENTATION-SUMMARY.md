## Configuration Requirements

### GitHub Secrets (Optional but Recommended)

| Secret | Purpose | How to Add |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `SNYK_TOKEN` | Snyk API authentication | Settings → Secrets → New secret |

### Branch Protection Rules

Required for main branch:

1. ✅ Require a pull request before merging
2. ✅ Require status checks to pass:
   - `npm audit — Dependency Vulnerabilities`
   - `Lint, Format & Typecheck`
   - `Unit & Integration Tests`
3. ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging

### Dependabot Configuration

Update `.github/dependabot.yml`:

```yaml
reviewers:
  - your-github-username
assignees:
  - your-github-username
```

## Security Policies Implemented

### Vulnerability Severity Handling

**Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0):**
- ❌ PRs blocked immediately
- 🚨 Requires immediate action
- 📧 Team notified

**High (CVSS 7.0-8.9):**
- ❌ PRs blocked immediately
- ⚠️ Requires action within 24 hours
- 📧 Team notified

**Moderate (CVSS 4.0-6.9):**
- ✅ PRs allowed with review
- 📋 Should be addressed within 2 weeks
- 📊 Tracked in reports

**Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9):**
- ✅ PRs allowed
- 📋 Address during regular updates
- 📊 Tracked in reports

### Accepted Risks

Process for handling vulnerabilities without patches:

1. Document in `docs/SECURITY.md`
2. Include:
   - CVE ID
   - Package name
   - Severity level
   - Reason for acceptance
   - Compensating controls
   - Review date

### Patch Application Process

1. **Detection** — Dependabot or npm audit detects vulnerability
2. **Creation** — security-patches.yml creates PR with fix
3. **Review** — Team reviews changes
4. **Testing** — CI runs full test suite
5. **Merge** — Once approved and CI passes
6. **Deploy** — Changes deployed via CD pipeline

## Local Development

### Run Security Checks

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm run audit

# Check for high severity only
npm run audit:high

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm run audit:fix

# Full security check
npm run security:check
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Husky pre-commit hooks automatically run:

```bash
npm run prepare
```

## Troubleshooting

### Snyk Scan Fails

**Issue:** `SNYK_TOKEN not found`

**Solution:**
1. Add `SNYK_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets
2. Verify token is valid in Snyk dashboard
3. Check token has correct permissions

### npm audit Reports False Positives

**Issue:** Vulnerability reported but not applicable

**Solution:**
1. Check vulnerability details
2. Verify it doesn't affect code path
3. Document as accepted risk in SECURITY.md

### Dependabot PRs Not Creating

**Issue:** No PRs created by Dependabot

**Solution:**
1. Check `.github/dependabot.yml` syntax
2. Verify Dependabot is enabled
3. Wait for next scheduled run

### Branch Protection Blocking Merges

**Issue:** PR blocked due to security checks

**Solution:**
1. Review security report in PR
2. Fix vulnerabilities: `npm audit fix`
3. Commit and push changes
4. Wait for CI to re-run

---

## Best Practices

1. **Review Dependencies** — Regularly audit package.json
2. **Keep Updated** — Merge Dependabot PRs promptly
3. **Test Thoroughly** — Always run full test suite
4. **Document Risks** — Keep SECURITY.md updated
5. **Monitor Alerts** — Check GitHub security alerts weekly
6. **Communicate** — Notify team of critical vulnerabilities
