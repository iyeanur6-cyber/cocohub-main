## Feature Implementation

### Core Functionality
- [x] Fetch today's medication schedule
  - Check medication dates (start/end)
  - Get dose logs for today
  - Mark as taken/pending status

- [x] Fetch upcoming appointments
  - Get next 5 appointments across all pets
  - Sort by date and time
  - Include vet information

- [x] Calculate pet health scores
  - Base 100 score with adjustments
  - Factor in activity level (0-20 point penalty)
  - Factor in temperature anomalies (0-15 point penalty)
  - Use last 7 days of metrics
  - Return 75 as default when no metrics

### Widget Update Mechanisms
- [x] On app foreground
  - Listen to AppState changes
  - Trigger refresh when state becomes 'active'

- [x] On notification receipt
  - Listen to notification responses
  - Check notification type (medication/appointment/health)
  - Trigger refresh if relevant

- [x] Manual update trigger
  - `forceWidgetUpdate()` for testing
  - `refreshWidgetData()` for direct calls

### Data Sharing
- [x] iOS: App groups via UserDefaults
  - Group identifier: `group.app.cocohub.mobile`
  - Data key: `cocohub_widget_data`

- [x] Android: SharedPreferences
  - Prefs name: `CocohubWidgetPrefs`
  - Data key: `cocohub_widget_data`

### Deep Linking
- [x] Medication deep link: `cocohub://medication/{id}`
- [x] Appointment deep link: `cocohub://appointment/{id}`
- [x] Health deep link: `cocohub://health/{petId}`

### Widget Sizes
- [x] Small (1x1)
  - Next medication, appointment, health score
- [x] Medium (2x1)
  - Medications and appointments columns
- [x] Large (2x2)
  - Full health overview with all details

## Testing

- [x] All files follow existing code style
- [x] No console logging (uses proper logging)
- [x] Proper error handling throughout
- [x] Comprehensive commit messages

## Build & Deployment

### EAS Build
- [ ] `eas build --platform ios --profile development` succeeds
- [ ] `eas build --platform android --profile development` succeeds
- [ ] `eas build --platform all --profile preview` succeeds
- [ ] Production build succeeds

### App Store / Google Play
- [ ] iOS widget registers with App Store
- [ ] Android widget registers with Play Store
- [ ] Widget configuration appears in store listings
- [ ] Update notes include widget feature

## Next Steps After Merge

1. Update App Store and Google Play app descriptions
2. Add widget screenshots to store listings
3. Create user documentation for widget feature
4. Monitor crash reports related to widgets
5. Plan future enhancements (interactive widgets, lock screen widgets)

## Additional Notes

- Widget extensions are built automatically by EAS
- No manual native code modifications required during build
- Custom Expo plugin handles all native integration
- Test thoroughly on physical devices before release
- Widget data persists across app versions
