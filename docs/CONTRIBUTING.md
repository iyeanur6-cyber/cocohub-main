## Coding Standards

To maintain high code quality, please follow these guidelines:

- **Clean Code Practices**: Write readable, maintainable code. Use meaningful variable and function names, avoid code duplication, and follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation consistently across all files.

- **Linting**: Ensure your code passes TypeScript type checking. Run `npm run typecheck` before submitting.

- **File Organization**: Follow the existing project structure. Place new files in appropriate directories (e.g., services in `src/services/`, utilities in `src/utils/`).

- **Documentation**: Add comments for complex logic and update documentation as needed.

## Commit Message Format

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages. This helps maintain a clear and organized git history.

Format: `type(scope): description`

Common types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
- `feat: add QR code generation for pet profiles`
- `fix: resolve authentication issue with blockchain service`
- `docs: update API documentation for pet service`

## Pull Request Requirements

Before submitting a pull request, ensure:

- Your PR targets the `main` branch.
- It includes a clear description of the changes made and the problem solved.
- All existing tests pass, and new tests are added for new features.
- The code passes TypeScript type checking (`npm run typecheck`).
- CI checks pass (including `npm run test:ci` for continuous integration).

Please keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix to make reviews easier.

## Issue Reporting

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and general discussions.

### Bug Reports
When reporting a bug, please include:

- **Clear Title**: A concise description of the issue.

## Stellar Development Setup

Cocohub uses the [Stellar](https://stellar.org) network for blockchain-verified medical records.
This section guides you through the testnet setup required to work on any feature under
`src/services/stellar*` or `backend/src/stellar*`.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- The project dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- A Stellar testnet account (steps below)

### 1. Create a testnet account

Use the Stellar Laboratory or the `stellar-sdk` CLI to generate a new keypair:

```bash
node -e "
const { Keypair } = require('@stellar/stellar-sdk');
const kp = Keypair.random();
console.log('Public key:', kp.publicKey());
console.log('Secret key:', kp.secret());
"
```

Save the output — you will need both keys in the next steps.

### 2. Fund the account via Friendbot

Friendbot is a testnet-only faucet that credits 10 000 XLM to a new account:

```bash
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>"
```

Verify the account is funded:

```bash
curl "https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/accounts/<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>" | \
  node -e "const d=require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8'); console.log(JSON.parse(d).balances)"
```

### 3. Point `.env.development` at testnet Horizon

Add the following to your `.env.development` file (create it from `.env.example` if it does not
exist):

```bash
STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
STELLAR_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
STELLAR_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
STELLAR_PUBLIC_KEY=<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>
```

> **Never commit secret keys.** `.env.development` is gitignored; double-check with
> `git status` before pushing.

### 4. Run the local SEP-24 anchor mock

Cocohub uses [SEP-24](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md)
for deposit/withdrawal flows. A mock anchor server is provided for local development:

```bash
# Start the mock anchor (runs on http://localhost:8000)
npm run server:anchor:mock

# Verify the TOML is reachable
curl http://localhost:8000/.well-known/stellar.toml
```

The `TRANSFER_SERVER_SEP0024` key in the response confirms the mock is running. Configure your
`.env.development` with:

```bash
STELLAR_ANCHOR_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Troubleshooting

**`OperationError: op_underfunded` when submitting a transaction**

Your testnet account has run out of XLM. Re-fund it with Friendbot (step 2 above). Testnet
accounts reset periodically; bookmark the Friendbot URL and re-run it if you see this error after
a testnet reset.

**`NotFoundError: The resource at the url requested was not found`**

The account does not exist on testnet yet. This happens when the public key has never been funded.
Run the Friendbot curl command (step 2) before making any Horizon API calls.

**`stellar-sdk` throws `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'sequence')`**

The `loadAccount` call failed silently. Ensure `STELLAR_HORIZON_URL` is set to
`https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` (not the mainnet URL) and that the account is funded. Add
`console.log` around the `loadAccount` call to inspect the raw Horizon response.

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing with Detox

Cocohub uses [Detox](https://wix.github.io/Detox/) for end-to-end testing on iOS Simulator and Android Emulator.

### Prerequisites

- Xcode (iOS) or Android Studio (Android) installed
- A running simulator/emulator
- App built in debug or release mode (see below)

### Setup

```bash
# Install Detox CLI globally
npm install -g detox-cli

# Install project dependencies (Detox is included as a devDependency)
npm install
```

### Build the app for E2E

```bash
# iOS debug build
detox build --configuration ios.sim.debug

# Android debug build
detox build --configuration android.emu.debug
```

### Run E2E tests

```bash
# iOS
detox test --configuration ios.sim.debug

# Android
detox test --configuration android.emu.debug
```

### Run against a seeded test database

```bash
# Seed minimal test data first
npm run seed:test

# Then run E2E tests
detox test --configuration ios.sim.debug
```

### Test suites

| File | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `e2e/onboarding.test.ts` | User registration → login flow |
| `e2e/addPet.test.ts` | Add a new pet |
| `e2e/healthRecord.test.ts` | Log a health record + search |
| `e2e/sos.test.ts` | Emergency SOS flow |

### Configuration

Detox is configured in `.detoxrc.js` at the project root. Supported configurations:

- `ios.sim.debug` / `ios.sim.release`
- `android.emu.debug` / `android.emu.release`
